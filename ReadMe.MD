# Life Expectancy and GDP Project

## Project Goals
This project analyzes the relationship bewteen the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

## Section I: Data Visualization (Scatterplots with trend lines)
- A graph including six countries
- The life expectancy of individual countries over the years 

## Section II: Data Summary and Hypothesis Tests
- For each country, evaluate the correlation coefficient between the life expectancy and the GDP and the p-value.
- Rank the slope of the trend lines across countries and their GDP level

## Conclusion
- Higher GDP associated with longer life expectancy. 
- The positive effect of GDP on life expectancy is lower for countries with higher GDP.
